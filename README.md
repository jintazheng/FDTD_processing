# 2-D Acoustic FDTD Simulation Demo for Processing 2 & 3


## Outline

This is a truly physical simulation program of the sound wave propagation in a two-dimensional field filled with fluid media and Mur's 2nd order absorbing boundary or a total reflecting wall.  
This program solves the "2D Acoustic FDTD (finite-difference time-domain) method". The dark part consists of air (332 m/s) and the brighter part consists of a mixture of air and helium (468 m/s). The grid resolution is 10 mm/pixel and the time step is 15 us/step (us = micro second = 1/1000000 second). A single pulse of sinusoidal wave at 1 kHz with Hann window is transmitted.  
Have fun!!

### Processing 2.x Users
Processing 2.x users should use the files in /acoustic_2d_fdtd_processing2/ folder.

### Processing 3.x Users
Processing 3.x users should use the files in /acoustic_2d_fdtd_processing3/ folder.

In both cases, **the folder name must be same as the name of .pde file.**


## Technical Notes
This program has been tested with Processing 2.2.1 or 3.1.2 (64bit) both on Windows and OSX. The speed of calculation depends on the CPU power of your PC. Intel Core i3 series or higher is recommended.
